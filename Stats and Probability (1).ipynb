Normalization can also help to prevent bias in machine learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with features that have different scales or units of measurement.

The analysis involves calculating the sum of squares for each factor and their interaction and dividing them by their respective degrees of freedom to obtain the mean squares. Then, the F-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean squares for each factor and their interaction by the mean squares within groups. The F-statistic is compared to a critical value based on the degrees of freedom and the chosen level of significance.\n",
